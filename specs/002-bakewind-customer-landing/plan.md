# Implementation Plan: BakeWind SaaS Landing & Customer Portal

**Branch**: `002-bakewind-customer-landing` | **Date**: 2025-09-27 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/Users/nuuk/Documents/apps/bakewind/specs/002-bakewind-customer-landing/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from file system structure or context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Create a SaaS marketing landing page and customer portal for BakeWind bakery management software. The primary requirement is to provide a public-facing entry point where potential customers can discover the software, view pricing plans, sign up for 14-day free trials, and existing subscribers can log in to access their bakery management dashboard. Technical approach includes SolidStart frontend with Tailwind CSS, NestJS backend with PostgreSQL, and Stripe integration for subscription billing.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.6, Node.js 22+
**Primary Dependencies**: SolidStart 1.1, NestJS, Drizzle ORM, Tailwind CSS 4.1
**Storage**: PostgreSQL (backend), session-based auth via httpOnly cookies
**Testing**: Vitest (frontend), Jest (backend), contract testing for APIs
**Target Platform**: Web browsers (SSR/SPA), Linux server deployment
**Project Type**: web - frontend (bakewind-customer) + backend (bakewind-api)
**Performance Goals**: <200ms page loads, <1s trial signup flow, 60fps animations
**Constraints**: SEO optimized, mobile responsive, WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
**Scale/Scope**: 10k+ trial signups/month, 1k concurrent users, 20 pages/components

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Core Principles Compliance**:
- [x] Database-First: User/subscription schema design drives API contracts and frontend state
- [x] Type Safety: TypeScript strict mode, Drizzle typed schemas, SolidJS reactive types
- [x] TDD: Contract tests before API implementation, component tests before UI
- [x] Separation: Frontend (presentation), Backend (business logic), Database (persistence) layers
- [x] Observability: Structured logging for auth flows, metrics for trial conversions

**Standards Compliance**:
- [x] API follows RESTful conventions: POST /auth/trial-signup, GET /auth/user, etc.
- [x] Database changes via migrations only: Drizzle migrations for user/subscription tables
- [x] Security requirements addressed: JWT tokens, input validation, CORS, rate limiting

```

**Structure Decision**: Web application architecture with separate frontend (SolidStart) and backend (NestJS) applications. The bakewind-customer frontend serves as the public-facing SaaS portal, while bakewind-api provides the backend services. This separation enables independent deployment and scaling of the customer acquisition frontend from the main bakery management system.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh claude`
     **IMPORTANT**: Execute it exactly as specified above. Do not add or remove any arguments.
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each contract → contract test task [P]
- Each entity → model creation task [P] 
- Each user story → integration test task
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation 
- Dependency order: Models before services before UI
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

**Estimated Output**: 25-30 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |


## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:
- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 1: Design complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 2: Task planning complete (/plan command - describe approach only)
- [ ] Phase 3: Tasks generated (/tasks command)
- [ ] Phase 4: Implementation complete
- [ ] Phase 5: Validation passed

**Gate Status**:
- [x] Initial Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] Post-Design Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] All NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved
- [ ] Complexity deviations documented
